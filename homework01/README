My program runs fine batched on mult.asm, but doesn't run at all on fib.asm.  

It gives me the same error if I try to run it batched or ir I try to just execute fib.asm by itself (by typing X <addr>). Because of that I don't think it's a problem with the code I wrote, but with the source code somewhere. I spent forever trying to fix it and made no headway, even redownloading the original source code and pasteing in my changes section by section.

at the root of the error was a problem in type comparasions that was handled by code that I didn't touch (or possibly touched and broke without knowing it)
